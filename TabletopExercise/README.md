# TabletopExercise

**Comprehensive cybersecurity tabletop exercise design and facilitation framework**

TabletopExercise is both a **PAI skill** and an **MCP server**. As a PAI skill it guides an AI agent through designing, facilitating, and evaluating exercises interactively. As an MCP server it exposes 10 schema-validated tools that any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, Mistral Vibe) can call programmatically to generate, validate, and enrich exercise materials — including AI-generated images for attack vectors, evidence, and atmosphere.

## Overview

Enhanced from the original SOC Manager Table Top Designer, this framework provides a complete methodology for designing, facilitating, and evaluating cybersecurity tabletop exercises for both technical and executive audiences.

**Key Enhancements:**
- ✅ **Technical Atomics**: Executable inject sequences for realistic scenario delivery
- ✅ **SOP/Playbook Gap Analysis**: Automated checklist generation for missing procedures
- ✅ **Threat Model Integration**: Scenarios based on real-world attack patterns
- ✅ **European-Anchored Framework**: ENISA exercise methodology, NIS2, ISO/IEC 27035 + 27001, DORA scope note; CTEP-lineage mechanics retained as optional reference
- ✅ **2025-2026 AI Threats**: Deepfake attacks, automated threat chains, supply chain compromise
- ✅ **PAI Tool Integration**: Caido, Browser MCP, JS Analyzer workflows

## Quick Start

### For Exercise Designers

```
Goal: Design a tabletop exercise

1. Define objectives (1-3 measurable goals)
   Example: "Validate ransomware response playbook and backup restoration procedures"

2. Select audience
   - Executive: C-suite, Board → Business impact focus
   - Technical: SOC, IR team → Detection/response focus
   - Hybrid: Cross-functional → Coordination focus

3. Choose scenario type
   - Ransomware, BEC, Supply Chain, K8s Compromise, DDoS, Insider Threat, etc.

4. Generate materials using this skill
   - Scenario brief
   - Facilitator guide with injects
   - Technical atomics for runner (if technical scenario)
   - Evaluation forms
   - SOP/playbook gap analysis checklist
```

### For Exercise Facilitators

```
Goal: Run a tabletop exercise

Pre-Exercise:
- Review facilitator guide and inject cards
- Runner tests all technical atomics
- Verify participant list and contact info
- Prepare evaluation forms for observers

During Exercise (60-90 min):
- Set ground rules (psychological safety, learning focus)
- Present initial scenario (T+0)
- Deliver timed injects per atomic schedule
- Use open-ended questions to stimulate discussion
- Document observations in real-time

Post-Exercise:
- Hot wash (20-30 min immediate debrief)
- After-Action Report with findings
- Generate SOP/playbook gap analysis
- Assign action items with owners and deadlines
```

### For Post-Exercise Analysis

```
Goal: Identify gaps and improve processes

1. Review exercise observations
2. Generate gap analysis checklist (automatic via skill)
3. Prioritize gaps: Critical → High → Medium → Low
4. Assign owners and deadlines
5. Track implementation
6. Schedule follow-up exercise in 6-12 months
```

## MCP Server

The TabletopExercise skill also ships as an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**, allowing any AI coding agent to call it programmatically to enrich scenario cards in a schema-validated, additive-only way.

### Setup

Replace `/path/to/TabletopExercise/generators/mcp-server.ts` with the absolute path on your machine.

#### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude mcp add tabletop-exercise -- bun run /path/to/TabletopExercise/generators/mcp-server.ts
```

#### Gemini CLI

Add to `~/.gemini/settings.json` (global) or `.gemini/settings.json` (project):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tabletop-exercise": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "/path/to/TabletopExercise/generators/mcp-server.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### OpenAI Codex CLI

Via CLI:

```bash
codex mcp add tabletop-exercise -- bun run /path/to/TabletopExercise/generators/mcp-server.ts
```

Or add to `~/.codex/config.toml` (global) or `.codex/config.toml` (project):

```toml
[mcp_servers.tabletop-exercise]
command = "bun"
args = ["run", "/path/to/TabletopExercise/generators/mcp-server.ts"]
```

#### Mistral Vibe (CLI)

Add to `~/.vibe/config.toml` (global) or `.vibe/config.toml` (project):

```toml
[mcp_servers.tabletop-exercise]
command = "bun"
args = ["run", "/path/to/TabletopExercise/generators/mcp-server.ts"]
```

### Tools (10)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `check_scenario_completeness` | Parse a `.qmd` scenario card and return which enrichment sections are present/missing |
| `validate_exercise_data` | Validate an exercise-data object against the Zod schema; returns structured errors |
| `generate_exercise` | Produce `facilitator.html` + `participant.html` from exercise-data |
| `merge_exercise_data` | Additive-only merge — never overwrites existing keys in the base JSON |
| `validate_m_and_m_formatting` | Enforce M&M-specific rules (contemporary vs. historical scenario types) |
| `generate_exercise_qmd` | Generate native Quarto markdown: 4 sections appended to `index.qmd` + handout QMD files |
| `list_scenario_cards` | Walk a directory tree and return a completeness summary for every `.qmd` found |
| `generate_attack_vector_images` | Render attack-vector artifacts — HTML/CSS templates for UI subtypes (phishing, ransomware, invoices), AI images for physical subtypes (USB device) |
| `generate_evidence_images` | Render evidence artifacts — HTML/CSS templates for UI subtypes (SIEM logs, dark web listings, SCADA), AI images for physical subtypes (network diagrams) |
| `generate_atmosphere_images` | Generate AI atmosphere images: cover art, NPC portraits, location illustrations |

### Resources (3)

| URI | Content |
|-----|---------|
| `tabletop://schema` | Full JSON Schema derived from Zod — describes every field and enrichment section |
| `tabletop://atomics` | Full content of `ATOMICS-LIBRARY.md` |
| `tabletop://template` | Annotated template showing how each schema field maps to HTML output |

### `generate_exercise_qmd` output

Given a validated `exercise-data.json`, this tool appends four sections to a Quarto `index.qmd`:

1. **Inject Sequence** — timed injects with read-aloud text, conditional branches, IM notes
2. **NPC Dialogue Scripts** — verbatim lines with three emotional beats (under pressure / escalating / conceding)
3. **Red Herrings** — false leads with resolution scripts
4. **Post-Session Gap Analysis** — debrief-focused gap write-ups with remediation lists

It also writes `handout-a-[slug].qmd` and `handout-b-[slug].qmd` with print-safe CSS, IM-notes divs, and key discovery questions.

**Guards enforced before any file is written:**
- Em dash (`—`) in generated text → error (use `--` instead)
- Contemporary scenario `read_aloud` naming the malmon family → error
- `artifact_content` containing non-TEST-NET IP addresses → error
- Path traversal (`..`) in any file path argument → rejected

### Image generation

`generate_attack_vector_images` and `generate_evidence_images` use a **two-path routing strategy** based on artifact subtype:

| Path | Subtypes | API key required? |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **HTML/CSS template** | `phishing_email`, `ransomware_note`, `fraudulent_invoice`, `network_capture`, `dark_web_listing`, `scada_interface` | No |
| **AI provider** | `usb_device`, `network_diagram`, `period_photograph`, `portrait`, `location_illustration`, `cover_art` | Yes |

**Why two paths?** Diffusion models produce fuzzy, unreadable text when rendering UI-heavy artifacts. HTML templates inject `artifact_content` verbatim so text is always accurate and legible at any zoom. Physical and atmospheric artifacts (USB photos, portraits, location art) have no text to render and benefit from AI imagery.

UI-subtype artifacts receive `html_data` (a self-contained HTML string); AI-rendered artifacts receive `image_data` (base64 PNG). Both are rendered in `facilitator.html` — `html_data` as an inline `<div>` embed, `image_data` as an `<img>` tag.

**AI provider setup** (required only for physical/atmosphere subtypes):

```bash
cp TabletopExercise/generators/.env.example TabletopExercise/generators/.env
# edit .env — set IMAGE_PROVIDER and the matching API key
```

Set `IMAGE_PROVIDER` to a single provider or a **comma-separated priority chain** — each is tried in order, first success wins:

```
IMAGE_PROVIDER=openai              # single provider
IMAGE_PROVIDER=openai,replicate    # priority chain with fallbacks
```

If a provider fails (missing key, rate limit, API error), the next one in the chain is tried automatically. `provider_used` in the tool response reports which provider(s) fired.

Supported providers: `openai` (DALL-E 3, default), `gemini` (Imagen 4), `stability`, `replicate` (Flux Schnell), `ollama` (self-hosted).

Recommended workflow:
```
validate_exercise_data
  → generate_attack_vector_images  # html_data set for UI subtypes; image_data for physical
  → generate_evidence_images       # html_data set for UI subtypes; image_data for diagrams
  → generate_atmosphere_images     # image_data for all atmosphere subtypes
  → generate_exercise              # facilitator.html renders both html_data and image_data
  → generate_exercise_qmd          # handout PNGs written alongside .qmd files
```

### Running the tests

```bash
cd TabletopExercise/generators
bun run test-mcp.ts   # 83 assertions across 26 test groups — all in-process via InMemoryTransport
```

Tests 19-24 cover AI image generation: no-key error paths (physical subtypes), schema validation before provider check, `visual_style` round-trip, and `image_subtype` acceptance. Tests 25-26 cover the HTML template path (`email` → `html_data`, `log` → `html_data`). No API key required to run the test suite.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Scenario Generation

**Executive Scenarios** (60-90 min, non-technical)
- **Audience**: C-suite, Board, Executive Directors
- **Focus**: Business impact, decision-making, external communication, regulatory compliance
- **Language**: Non-technical, succinct, business-focused
- **Outcomes**: Improved executive/technical alignment, clarified crisis roles

**Technical Scenarios** (90-120 min, operational)
- **Audience**: SOC analysts, incident responders, IT Ops
- **Focus**: Detection/containment, forensics, tool usage, technical recovery
- **Language**: Deep technical content, command-line operations, log analysis
- **Outcomes**: Validated playbooks, identified tool gaps, improved coordination

**Scenario Types Based on Threat Models:**
- Ransomware with backup failure
- Business Email Compromise (BEC/OAuth)
- Supply Chain Breach (npm, CDN)
- Kubernetes Cluster Compromise
- Cloud Storage Misconfiguration (S3, GCS)
- Deepfake Social Engineering (AI-enhanced)
- Insider Threat
- DDoS Attack

### 2. Technical Atomics for Runners

Atomics are **executable action sequences** that runners perform to simulate realistic incident progression.

**Example Atomic:**
```markdown
## T+30 (Backup System Failure)
**Atomic ID**: BACKUP-FAIL-001
**Action**: Update backup system dashboard
**Status Change**: Replication status → "Failed - destination unreachable"
**Expected Response**: IT investigates backup server, discovers encrypted files
**If No Response**: Facilitator prompts: "Your backup monitoring shows failures..."
```

**Atomic Categories:**
- **Pre-Exercise Setup**: Environment preparation, test data staging
- **Timed Injects**: Scheduled scenario progressions
- **Conditional Responses**: Dynamic reactions to participant questions
- **Escalation Events**: Executive pressure, media inquiries

**Benefits:**
- Consistent scenario delivery across multiple exercises
- Realistic timing and pacing
- Runner confidence through clear instructions
- Reproducible exercises for A/B testing improvements

### 3. SOP/Playbook Gap Analysis

Automatically generates comprehensive checklists identifying missing procedures.

**Process:**
1. Scenario decomposition (identify all decision points)
2. Playbook mapping (check for documented procedures)
3. Gap identification (flag missing/inadequate)
4. Priority scoring (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

**Example Output:**
```markdown
## CRITICAL GAPS

### 1. Ransomware Containment Playbook - MISSING
**Scenario Trigger**: Multiple hosts showing encryption
**Required Decisions**:
  □ Network segmentation procedures
  □ Host isolation criteria
  □ AD credential reset procedures
  □ Encrypted file preservation

**Impact if Missing**: Delayed containment, lateral spread
**Recommendation**: Develop comprehensive ransomware playbook
**Owner**: _________ **Due Date**: _________
```

**Gap Categories:**
- **SOPs** (Standard Operating Procedures)
- **Process Issues** (Communication channels, approval workflows)
- **Tool Gaps** (Missing capabilities, integration failures)
- **Training Needs** (Knowledge deficiencies)

### 4. Threat Model Integration

Scenarios built from real-world threat intelligence and attack patterns:

**Sources:**
- OAuth 2.0 Security (RFC 6819)
- Kubernetes Security (CNCF, DoD guidance)
- Cloud Security (AWS, GCP, Azure documentation)
- IoT Device Vulnerabilities (MITRE)
- AI/ML Workload Threats (OWASP, AWS Bedrock)
- Supply Chain Attacks (npm, container registries)

**Example Scenario Mapping:**
```
Threat Model: OAuth 2.0 RFC 6819
→ Tabletop Scenario: Business Email Compromise via OAuth Token Theft
→ Attack Chain: Phishing → OAuth consent → Token theft → Account takeover → Fraudulent transaction
→ Decision Points: Token revocation, out-of-band verification, fraud investigation
→ Gap Analysis: OAuth security monitoring, token lifecycle management
```

### 5. European-Anchored Framework

Anchored to **ENISA exercise methodology, NIS2 Art. 21, ISO/IEC 27035 +
27001 A.5.24-27**, with **DORA Art. 24-25** in scope for financial
entities only (a tabletop is NOT DORA threat-led testing, Art. 26-27).
The Plan/Engage/Learn mechanics originate from the US CISA CTEP
tradition and are retained; US frameworks are optional reference, never
the primary citation.

**Plan → Engage → Learn**

**Planning Phase:**
- Define 1-3 measurable objectives
- Select realistic scenario matching risk profile
- Identify cross-functional participants
- Prepare materials (brief, injects, facilitator script)

**Engaging Phase:**
- Set ground rules (psychological safety)
- Present initial scenario (T+0)
- Progressive injects (timed complications)
- Facilitate discussion (open-ended questions)
- Document observations

**Learning Phase (M&M guide-not-judge debrief; full method in SKILL.md):**
- Reveal + event recall, round-share (every voice once before anyone
  twice), gap analysis (process gaps, not blame), map-to-reality,
  written commitments (implementation intentions)
- 6-8 debrief questions across four categories: operational, strategic,
  cultural/behavioural, learning transfer (at least one from each)
- Facilitator guides, never scores; capability reads are scored
  privately from observer notes/recording (deliverable tier T4 only)
- After-Action Report (strengths, gaps, recommendations; no game
  vocabulary), action items, implementation, follow-up exercise in
  6-12 months (ISO/IEC 27035 lessons-learned loop)

**Resources Integrated:**
- ENISA exercise methodology + regulatory hooks (NIS2, DORA, ISO 27035/27001)
- 100+ CISA scenario templates (optional reference)
- After-Action Report templates
- Objective-based performance analysis

```

---

## Best Practices

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Clear Objectives**: Define 1-3 measurable goals before scenario design
2. **Realistic Scenarios**: Match organizational risk profile, avoid "doomsday" plots
3. **Cross-Functional Participation**: Include all departments involved in real incidents
4. **Skilled Facilitation**: Draw solutions from participants, don't provide answers
5. **Psychological Safety**: Frame as learning, not performance evaluation
6. **Implement Findings**: Assign owners, deadlines, track completion (MOST CRITICAL!)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Not implementing lessons learned** (exercise becomes useless checkbox)
❌ **Unrealistic "movie-style hacking"** scenarios (participants can't relate)
❌ **Same participants every time** (limits organizational learning)
❌ **Inadequate debriefing time** (real learning happens in debrief)
❌ **Treating as performance evaluation** (creates defensive behavior)
❌ **Outdated contact lists** (critical failure during real incidents)

### Optimal Timing

- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes for quality discussion
- **Frequency**: Quarterly (high-risk orgs) or monthly (regulated industries)
- **Follow-Up**: 6-12 months to test implemented improvements

## Integration with PAI Security Tools

### Caido MCP Integration
For web application compromise scenarios:
```bash
# Demonstrate attack patterns during technical tabletops
/caido req.ext.eq:"php" AND req.query.matches:"eval|cmd"
# Show participants actual malicious requests
```

### Browser MCP Integration
For client-side attack scenarios (XSS, CSRF, OAuth phishing):
- Demonstrate exploit chains live during tabletop
- Capture screenshots/GIFs for inject materials
- Record attack sequences for training

### JS Analyzer Integration
For supply chain compromise scenarios:
```bash
# Analyze compromised npm package during tabletop
bun run /root/doctorswzl/src/index.ts malicious-package.js
# Show participants dangerous sinks and data exfiltration code
```

## Resources

### European Standards & Guidance (primary)
- **ENISA**: Cyber Europe exercise methodology + sectoral guidance (enisa.europa.eu)
- **NIS2 Art. 21/23**, **DORA Art. 24-25** (financial entities): the regulatory hooks an exercise evidences
- **ISO/IEC 27035**: incident management; **ISO/IEC 27001 A.5.24-27**: control mapping

### US Resources (optional/historical)
- **CISA Tabletop Exercise Packages**: cisa.gov/cybersecurity-tabletops (100+ scenarios)
- **NIST SP 800-84**: Guide to Test, Training, and Exercise Programs
- **CISA AAR Templates**: After-Action Report formats

### Threat Model Examples
- OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6819)
- Kubernetes Security (CNCF, DoD)
- Cloud Security (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- IoT Devices (MITRE)
- AI/ML Workloads (OWASP, AWS Bedrock)

### Research Foundation
Skill enhanced with learnings from:
- ENISA exercise methodology and the European regulatory drivers (NIS2, DORA)
- The M&M/HackBack guide-not-judge debrief method and its learning-science base (Kolb, Gibbs, AAR research)
- CISA Cybersecurity Tabletop Exercise framework and NIST 800-84 (historical lineage)
- Real-world practitioner experiences (Memorial Health Systems ransomware response)
- 2025-2026 emerging threat landscape (AI-powered attacks, supply chain focus)
- Other regulatory drivers where clients need them (HIPAA, PCI DSS)

## Version History

**v3.3** (15-07-2026) - Europeanized + M&M debrief method
- Reanchored to European standards (ENISA methodology, NIS2 Art. 21/23,
  ISO/IEC 27035 + 27001 A.5.24-27, DORA Art. 24-25 scope note); US
  frameworks (CISA CTEP, NIST 800-84) demoted to optional/historical
  reference, mechanics retained
- Learning Phase replaced with the M&M guide-not-judge debrief method:
  reveal -> round-share -> map-to-reality, five phases, four-category
  question taxonomy (operational / strategic / cultural-behavioural /
  learning transfer), written implementation intentions; facilitator
  never scores live, capability reads are T4 observer-scored only
- Fixed stale generator paths (pre-PAI install prefix) to
  `~/.claude/skills/`; SKILL.md version footer now tracks this
  changelog (was stuck at 2.0)

**v3.2** (2026-03-07) - HTML Artifact Templates
- Added `generate-html-artifacts.ts` — six self-contained HTML/CSS templates for UI-heavy artifact subtypes: `phishing_email` (macOS Mail client chrome), `ransomware_note` (dark splash screen with BTC address), `fraudulent_invoice` (white paper layout), `network_capture` (Wireshark dark table), `dark_web_listing` (terminal green-on-black), `scada_interface` (industrial HMI with CSS gauges)
- `generate_attack_vector_images` and `generate_evidence_images` now route UI subtypes to HTML templates (no API key required); physical subtypes still use AI providers
- UI-subtype artifacts receive `html_data` (self-contained HTML string); AI-rendered artifacts receive `image_data` (base64 PNG); `generate_exercise` renders both inline
- Added `html_data` field to `ArtifactSchema` in `schema.ts`
- Tests expanded from 75 to 83 assertions (Tests 25-26 verify HTML template path; Tests 19-20 updated to use physical subtypes for AI fallback coverage)

**v3.1** (2026-03-07) - AI Image Generation
- Added `generate-images.ts` — provider registry supporting OpenAI (DALL-E 3), Gemini (Imagen 4), Stability AI, Replicate (Flux Schnell), Ollama (self-hosted)
- `IMAGE_PROVIDER` accepts a comma-separated priority chain (`openai,replicate`) — each provider tried in order, first success wins; `provider_used` in tool response shows which provider(s) fired
- Added 3 new MCP tools: `generate_attack_vector_images`, `generate_evidence_images`, `generate_atmosphere_images`
- Added `ImageSubtypeSchema` (12 subtypes) and `VisualStyleSchema` for cross-scenario style consistency
- `generate_exercise` renders `<img>` tags for artifacts with `image_data`; cover art embedded in cover page
- `generate_exercise_qmd` writes `[slug].png` alongside handout QMD files when `image_data` is present
- API keys loaded from `.env` in generators directory; shell environment always takes precedence
- Tests expanded from 63 to 75 assertions (Tests 19-24 cover image generation error paths and schema)

**v3.0** (2026-03-07) - MCP Server + Quarto Output
- Added MCP server (`mcp-server.ts`) with 7 tools and 3 resources
- Added `schema.ts` — Zod v3 schemas as single source of truth for types, validation, and JSON Schema resource
- Added `generate_exercise_qmd` tool for native Quarto markdown output (inject sequence, NPC dialogue, red herrings, gap analysis, handout QMD files)
- Added M&M-specific validation: contemporary/historical scenario type rules, malmon family name guards, TEST-NET IP enforcement, em dash guard
- Added `merge_exercise_data` additive-only merge tool
- Added 63-assertion integration test suite using `InMemoryTransport` (18 test groups)
- Verified against M&M scenario cards: handout CSS, `quarto render` clean output, all 13 malmon family names

**v2.0** (2026-02-06) - Enhanced PAI Skill
- Added technical atomics generation for exercise runners
- Integrated SOP/playbook gap analysis framework
- Incorporated CISA CTEP methodology
- Added threat model-based scenario library
- Enhanced with 2025-2026 AI threat considerations
- Integrated PAI security tool workflows (Caido, Browser MCP, JS Analyzer)

**v1.0** (Original) - SOC Manager Table Top Designer
- Source: Arcanum-Sec redbluepurpleAI project
- Basic scenario generation for executive/technical audiences
- Incident response protocol focus
